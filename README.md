# GenericCable (in prep for IMAGE-2024)
Generic cable class for Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data modeling (forward) and inversion (adjoint).

More examples are coming soon ...

1. Forward modeling DAS for irregular fiber based on SPECFEM3D
2. DAS Full-waveform moment-tensor inversion
3. DAS Full-waveform Inversion
